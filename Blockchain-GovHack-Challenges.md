Besides automating the processes of the "last mile" of a very contentious process, the establishment of an ePrescribe™ Network, for prescription issuance and fulfillment, satisfies several “pain points” in four (4) out of the five (5) **Virtual Govhack Challenges**:
* **Second**: Reducing the Paper Footprint – the system will reduce the number of trees ‘killed’ by an amount equal to the number of trees needed for paper prescriptions.

* **Third**: Fighting Fraud and Proceeds of Crime – all stages of prescription (issuance and fulfillment) are tracked and recorded and represent immutable records that cannot be deleted or altered, thus aiding in reducing corruption and crime. A reduction in prescription opiate abuse will have a cascading effect on other forms of opiate abuse, such as heroin, which is often where those dependent on prescription pain pills turn when they can no longer afford access to illegal pills.  

* **Fourth**: The prescription workflow process is an integral part of the ‘medical record chain of care’ and as such ePrescribe™ will do its part in seeing that **the correct prescription gets to the right party** – in the right volume / amount, thus improving the patient care experience and reducing overall costs.

* **Fifth**: When ePrescribe™ is integrated / interfaced with the ePharma™ (Drug Tracking and Management System), the results unveil an **ePrescription™ Drug Tracking and Enforcement Platform™** that will be a welcomed addition to the cyber infrastructure of any Smart City.
