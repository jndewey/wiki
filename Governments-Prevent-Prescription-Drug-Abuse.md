## Counterfeit Prescriptions and Drug Abuse

The title should read "Government Can"; but this is my dream -- so. While the severity of the problem and numerous challenges are daunting, implementation of ePrescribe™ will help any Government prevent fraudulent / counterfeit prescriptions while eliminating the use of paper and other manual processes in the ‘**Prescription Creation-Fulfillment**’ workflow process in the UAE.

The Patient/Caregiver will no longer receive a paper prescription and therefore cannot make paper copies to take to multiple Pharmacies. Doctor and Pharmacists will not be able to print prescriptions – paper subscriptions will not be accepted anywhere in the UAE. ePrescribe™ will prevent over-prescriptions while deterring pharmacists from filling the same prescription multiple times. ePrescribe™ does all this while making the overall process simpler for all participants.

The transparency features of the Blockchain allow the tracking and management of all details within the prescription workflow process; from the point of issuance to that of fulfillment. When secured against a Blockchain network, the prescription data’s integrity has consensus. 

An indelible, immutable record of the stage of each prescription (issued and filled) is available / viewable on the Blockchain for inspection by ‘Regulator Dashboards’ (Blockchain Nodes) installations at the Ministries of Health / Economy / Interior and the local Police Departments.

Using Government - Regulator Dashboards, these Ministries and Police Departments will be able to view prescriptions across any Entity, Doctor, Patient (caregiver), Pharmacist relationship; associated with the issuance and fulfillment of a specific drug.  Regulators/Official Agencies will also receive timely application alerts, notifications, and messages of over-prescriptions. 

This information will also be available to Doctors and Pharmacists. The proposed system will provide all necessary information only to those who have a legitimate need to have it.  No patient data is at risk of disclosure to any person not authorized by law to receive it.  

ePrescribe™ makes use the of existing National Digital Identity System (if exists) - In the UAE as an example: An Emirates Identity Card is issued to each resident. Non-residents will have passports and work visa identification (managed by the respective ministries). This identity management effort will aid in assuring prescriptions are filled on behalf of the correct patient within the ePrescribe™ participating network. The Ministries of Health and Economy will provide registration/licensing details for verification of a Medical Entity.
