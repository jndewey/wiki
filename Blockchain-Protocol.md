## How Will it be Used - Process Steps

Blockchain is the underlying technology / framework that guides the structure of the Blockchain and development of applications providing a protocol for corporate permissioned Blockchain platforms. A Blockchain solution records specific transaction data to be shared across a network in which collaboration and transparency are critical. The Blockchain’s proof-of-work or proof-of-state or zero-knowledge proof consensus, cryptographic public/private key access, and distributed data bring a new level of integrity to health care data.

* The physical identity of the Patient is used to create a digital identity on the Blockchain by using the Emirates ID Card, issued to each resident, or the Passport of non-residents.  
* The Medical Facility’s corporate identity is obtained from the Ministry of Economy. 
* The Ministry of Health provides licensing / renewal information.
With ePrescribe™, there’s always one complete set of information for a prescription issuance and fulfillment; a needed change compared to the multitude of siloed, often incomplete data sources patients, medical practitioners and facilities face today.
Blockchains are much better for transactional data, which, by nature, is comprised of data points that are independent from each other. Blockchains allow data to be stored independently in a modular fashion, which fits the single block nature of information in blockchains.
Example: Patient needs medication
* Medication = Drug = Asset -- An Asset has value -- Drug = Asset (with medicinal value)

Patient wishes to acquire asset
1.	Patient must be given approval to own/purchase the asset
2.	Pharmacist must have permission from the Doctor to transfer the asset the Patient
3.	Doctor gives Patient permission to acquire the drug, (i.e. an electronic prescription) 
o	Doctor holds license allowing him to notify the Pharmacist to transfer the asset
4.	Pharmacist is licensed to dispense medications 
5.	Doctor notifies Pharmacist that the Patient can receive the asset
o	Pharmacist transfers the asset the Patient after verifying identity
6.	Patient pays the Pharmacist for the asset

The three main processing steps are stored on the Blockchain for each prescription: 
* The Doctor approves the Patient’s ownership of the Drug by issuing a prescription that notifies the Pharmacist to transfer the Drug to the Patient

* The Pharmacy receives payment for the Drug from the Patient
* The patient receives the filled prescription (Drug)

Therefore, in the example above we are moving an - asset of value - from one party to another in consideration for payment made to acquire the asset. The main transactions per prescription, (i.e. 1) Doctor approves, 2) Patient pays, 3) Pharmacist dispenses) are stored on the Blockchain.  Naturally, there are other pieces of information / data that are collected at each of these processing points and stored on the chain or in a database. 

Smart Contracts - Manage the ‘relationship’ between all Participants

Doctor / Patient - Provides approval of Drug – Patient pays Doctor
Doctor / Pharmacist - Pharmacist requires permission to dispense Drug
Doctor / Licensing Agency - Medical Doctor certified / licensed and up to date
Pharmacist / Licensing Agency -Pharmacist’s licensed and up to date
Patient / Pharmacist - Patient and Pharmacist exchange assets
Facility / Regulator - Ministry of Economy (CR)
