Blockchain can provide an incredibly powerful tool to curb the abuse of prescription medications, including opiates, and other illicit street drugs like heroin, which as noted above, often become a replacement for prescription pain pills out of necessity.  When opiate pain medications are combined with other controlled substances that may be legally prescribed, including stimulants like amphetamine (e.g., Adderall), and anti-anxiety pills like benzodiazepines (e.g., Xanax, Valium and Ativan), the total consumption of medications with a high risk of abuse is staggering.  In the fight to curb drug abuse, the first line of defense is the integrity of the system used to deliver these drugs to individuals with a legitimate need.  Current systems across the world, including the United States, lack adequate protections and ways to prevent access to such drugs by those without a legitimate need.

Developing a system with sufficient safeguards is far more difficult to do than you may initially think.  There are several logistical challenges and policy concerns that must be considered.  In some countries, including the United States, pharmacies are regulated by separate political subdivisions.  For example, in the United States, each state has its own regulatory regime.  That’s fifty different sets of laws, licensing administrations and repositories for information and data concerning pharmacies and the distribution of medicines to and from those pharmacies.  In addition, attempts to overcome these challenges must be done without upsetting important policy concerns, such as the privacy of medical and patient records and the uniqueness of the doctor and patient relationship.  

Blockchain is uniquely positioned to overcome these challenges while strengthening privacy rights and enhancing medical care provided by doctors and other healthcare professionals.  Blockchain allows us to solve these challenges because of capabilities that are inherent in the architecture and design of cryptographic-based, distributed ledgers.  More specifically, a blockchain based approach allows us to easily work within a multi-jurisdiction environment or even a cross-border context in cases where nations want to collaborate. 

Public key encryption, together with the distributed nature of blockchains, provide for the most secure way to store patient information based on existing technology.  Public key encryption eliminates the risk associated with username and password protocols generally used with centralized databases.  Doctors and other professionals with access to blockchain based solutions access patient information and data by possessing a private key that can be stored in a secure manner (e.g., a hardware wallet).  Without the private key, unauthorized individuals are not able to access the system, and more importantly, traditional phishing schemes and other social engineering techniques responsible for most successful data breaches, are useless against the security of a well-designed blockchain.

As important, blockchain allows us to dramatically improve the integrity of the system for dispensing controlled medications. One of the key problems solved by bitcoin was the inherent double spend risk associated with digital currencies. In any system lacking absolute trust, there was always the risk that a person might spend the same unit of value more than once. Bitcoin eliminated this risk and created a trustless environment without risk of double spending. Our approach to restoring integrity in the dispensing system is to treat each prescription in a similar way to bitcoin. The ePrescribe™ platform treats prescriptions as inputs and outputs that are cryptographically created from an approved source (i.e., cryptographically signed by a licensed physician) and consumed by a transaction between a licensed pharmacy and the patient (or duly authorized caregiver). With this approach, only legitimate prescriptions are generated, and most importantly, each such prescription can only be filled once.

There have been prior attempts to utilize traditional, centralized databases to increase integrity in the system. Centralized databases, however, are ill-suited to address the issue. Their centralized design raises privacy concerns as sensitive patient medical information becomes potentially available to individuals without a legitimate need to access it. Furthermore, because their functionality is limited to serving as a registry where data can be stored, introducing it to the process of filling and dispensing a prescription adds additional work and time to fill prescriptions, which in turn, results in lower rates of usage. These privacy and utility concerns are addressed by a blockchain solution. The ePrescribe™ platform is designed to allow for maximum patient data privacy. As a standard component of the core platform, patient data is only available to the extent necessary to treat a patient and to dispense medicine to that patient. The reality, however, is that there is no one privacy protocol that is compliant or optimal for every different regulatory regime. These different approaches to privacy policy are easily addressed by the ePrescribe™ platform with simple adjustments to the underlying smart contract, with each such contract acting as the business logic controlling both the schema of the ledger and the visibility of data on the ledger to participants based on their role (e.g., treating doctor, patient, pharmacist). Each smart contract written for the ePrescribe™ platform is developed specifically for each jurisdiction and includes collaboration with pharmacists, physicians and legal counsel familiar with the applicable regulatory regimes. While each ePrescribe™ smart contract is tailored, the ePrescribe™ platform has the capability to allow cross ledger “transactions” or queries to the extent desired by jurisdictions wanting to collaborate. This is an invaluable tool for preventing doctor shopping and similar activities across borders. ePrescribe™ has been designed with an architecture that also allows for easy integration or interfacing between separate ledgers even if not originally contemplated by either ledger before deployment. This functionality is made simple by the nature of distributed ledgers and advances in the development of smart contracts.

While the ePrescribe™ platform is an incredibly powerful tool, it requires virtually no additional hardware for any of the participants. Doctors and pharmacists will continue to use their existing computers to access the ePrescribe™ ledger through a simple, easy to use web portal. ePrescribe™ has been designed with an intuitive yet feature rich user interface. Patients will generally interact with their existing mobile phone. Anyone with a phone capable of receiving SMS texts can receive a prescription on the ePrescribe™ platform. Even those without a phone can have their prescription converted to paper with a QR code representing the public address where the prescription input can be accessed. By leveraging the benefits of blockchain technology, the entire life cycle of a prescription and the supply of controlled drugs can be altered without any large investment or cost to any of the participants.

Because ePrescribe™ is designed to operate as a comprehensive prescription system in lieu of the traditional, centralized databases maintained by each pharmacy or chain of pharmacies, current information about drug side effects, dangerous interactions and other critical information is always available to the ePrescribe™ platform. When this information can be applied to all prescriptions issued to the patient (regardless of doctor or where filled), pharmacists can make better decisions about suitability of specific medicines based on a more complete history. This decision making can be supplemented by algorithms designed to spot potential dangers in dispensing medicine. As artificial intelligence continues to improve, these types of tools will continually be updated and seamlessly incorporated into the ePrescribe™ platform. As the ePrescribe™ platform itself continues to evolve, one of the major design considerations will continue to be what information belongs on the ledger and what information should be provided by oracles. For purposes of this demo, all information is on the ledger solely as a matter of convenience as the scope of our challenge did not involve the use of oracles. Future iterations of ePrescribe™ will immediately begin incorporation of oracles and removing information not critical to the ledger.

The ePrescribe™ platform is the first phase of a two-phase implementation. The second phase will focus on the provenance of prescription medicine from ports to pharmacies and other points of distribution. We have implemented the patient-centered ePrescribe™ first for three primary reasons. First, it will provide the most immediate social benefits. Second, it requires no appropriations for equipment or other items that may be needed for the provenance phase. Third, the second phase without the “last mile” portion of the supply chain secured would remain insecure even after its deployment. Counterfeit medicine is a serious problem throughout the world. The Health Researching Funding Organization reports that between 10% to 30% of all medicine sold in developing nations are counterfeit. The total value of the counterfeit drug market exceeds $200 billion on an annual basis. Counterfeit drugs raise not only intellectual property issues, but also health safety concerns since many counterfeit drugs are made in ill-equipped labs with little or no quality control systems. When phase two is completed, every aspect of the way we obtain and dispense medicine will be improved, all through assurances and enhanced integrity made possible by blockchain technology.
