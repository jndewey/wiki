**Their Effects on The Community At Large**

The number of individuals and families who are being harmed by drug abuse continues to exceed any notion of an acceptable level.  Opiate addiction has become an outright epidemic in many places around the world, including developed nations like the United States.  It is reported that up to 36,000,000 people suffer from addiction to opiates.  Opiate overdoses are on the rise as many users use heroin cut with adulterants, many of which are significantly more powerful than pure heroin.  Fentanyl and methyl fentanyl were found in batches of street heroin in several incidents that occurred in the United States during the last couple of years.  In each case, the result was the same—a significant increase in overdoses all tied to a source of poorly cut heroin.  As the production of dangerous analogs and other synthetic compounds continue to grow, so will the rise in heroin overdoses resulting from adulterants.

Policymakers have struggled for decades to combat the growing impact illicit drugs have had.  To date, the existing strategies have failed.  The United States alone spent over $15 billion in 2010 in its war on drugs.  This is in addition to spending by state and local governments.  The true cost of existing policies is exponentially higher when incarceration for drug offenses is included.  For example, in 2009, there were 1,663,582 arrests for drug law violations in the United States.  The cost to process these arrests, try defendants and to incarcerate them is high.  Many incarcerations also disrupt family units making it even more difficult for those families to live without financial aid from the government. 

Regardless of your opinion on drug use, most agree that drug abuse can have a devastating impact on families and society more broadly, including higher healthcare expenditures and loss of productivity.  Similarly, most people agree that traditional drug policies focused on supply interdiction, the criminal justice system and the use of military force have done little to solve the problem.  While some countries, like Canada and Switzerland, have experimented with more progressive approaches, including mitigation strategies, none of them are sufficient to address the enormity of the problem.

Many people who abuse heroin and other opiates became addicted to opiates while taking prescription pain medicine legally prescribed to them.  Once addicted, an opiate user faces almost unthinkable pain and anguish if they suddenly cease use.  Thus, most will do anything to ensure a continued supply of opiates.  Street prices for prescription painkillers is high, with a single pill fetching upwards of $50 to $60.  After enough time, many dependent on opiates will eventually move to heroin, which is now significantly cheaper than pills when measured by dosing potential and strength.  While an addict may need $120 worth of pills to get well, a $120 worth of heroin might be enough for half a dozen doses.  As the progression continues, many heroin users, who originally started using by snorting powder heroin, eventually move to intravenous injections—which provide more effect with less heroin.
